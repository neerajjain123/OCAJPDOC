# Leaders are right a lot.  They have strong business judgment and good instincts
# Use sound business judgment to make the right decisions quickly and achieve results, even in the absence of complete data?
# Question whether decisions are being made in the Company’s and customer’s best interest and change course when they are not?

# Actively seek out the best solutions, recognizing that great ideas often come from others? 

-	Tell me about a business model decision or key technology decision or other important strategic decision you had to make for which there was not enough data or benchmarks.  In the absence of all the data, what guided your choice and how did you make the call? (follow up with the alternatives considered and how/why they were ruled out in favor of the path taken, what was the risk mitigation strategy? Outcome?  Ask for another example and potentially a third until you are sure this is a pattern and not a one off).  (Manager)
-	What are the top strategic issues you’ve had to face in your current role?  What decisions did you end up making?  (Manager)
