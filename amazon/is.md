# Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.  They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”.  As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

# Simplify and always encourage others to innovate and change inefficient or unnecessarily complex processes?
# Use new ideas and methods to do your job better and enhance the customer experience?

# Create an environment that encourages breakthrough thinking that is simple?
# Encourage innovation and invention for the right reasons, helping others not to unnecessarily reinvent the wheel?


- How do you draw new thinking and innovation out of your team?   Give an example of how your approach led to a specific innovation.  (Manager)
- Tell me about a time when you have enabled your team/ a team member to implement a significant change or improvement.  (Manager)
