# :  Leaders are owners.  They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.  They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.  They never say “that’s not my job”.

# Create a vision for your team that aligns with the customer experience?
# Foster an environment of autonomy where an employee prioritize and make decisions?
# Think about the impact of your decisions on other teams, sites and the customer over time?
# Coach and mentor your team to understand the big picture, how their role supports the overall objectives of Amazon, and how it ties to others?



-	How do you ensure your team stays connected to the company vision and the bigger picture?  Give an example of when you felt a team or individual goal was in conflict with the company vision.  What did you do?  (Manager)
-	Tell me about an initiative you undertook because you saw that it could benefit the whole company or your customers, but wasn’t within any group’s individual responsibility so nothing was being done.  (Manager)
