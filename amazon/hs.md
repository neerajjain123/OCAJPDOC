# Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.  Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes.  Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

# Raise the quality bar by demanding that your team delivers high quality products, services and solutions?
# Teach and coach employees about setting their own high standards and exceeding customer expectations?
# Provide feedback to employees when work is of high quality and coach to continually improve work?
