-	Tell me about a time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and you had to go down several layers to figure it out.  Who did you talk with and what information proved most valuable?  How did you use that information to help solve the problem? 



- 	When your direct reports are presenting a plan or issue to you, how do you know if the underlying assumptions are the correct ones?  What actions do you take to validate assumptions or data?   (Manager)

- 	Can you tell me about a specific metric you have used to identify a need for a change in your department?  Did you create the metric or was it already available?  How did this and other information influence the change?
