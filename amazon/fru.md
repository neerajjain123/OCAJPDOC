# We try not to spend money on things that don’t matter to customers.  Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.  There are no extra points for headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

# Ask, “Does this spend make a positive impact for the customer?

# Role model behaviors for team by not exhibiting “hierarchical” behavior like taking a larger office, expensing lunches, being extravagant?
# Being transparent with team about costs – creating a general awareness that things cost money? 
# Understand the difference between frugal and cheap?
