# Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.  Leaders have conviction and are tenacious.  They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion.  Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

# Question rigorously, challenge assumptions and escalate issues up and across the “food chain” when you’re not satisfied, even if unpopular?
# Stand up for what you believe is in the best interest of the company and our customers?

# Openly demonstrate your support and commitment to decisions that have been made, even though you may not have originally agreed?  Refrain from being transparent with these types of decisions in the best interests of your employees?

- Give an example of when you had to support a business initiative with which you didn’t necessarily agree.  How did you handle it?  (Manager)


- Tell me about a time when you pushed back against a decision that negatively impacted your team.  What was the issue and how did it turn out? (Manager)
