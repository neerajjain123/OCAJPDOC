# Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.  They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers. 

# Take a radical approach and risks when necessary, always questioning traditional assumptions in pursuit of the biggest and best idea?

#	Create a gutsy mission that employees can be inspired by and get behind; provide direction for how to get there and explain how everything fits into the long-term plan?
#	Continually communicate the big picture and mission to the team in a manner that gets employees excited (as a result, employees want to get out of bed and come to work each day)?
#	Actively explore new ideas from team members, encouraging risk taking when appropriate?
