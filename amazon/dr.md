What I think helped team most was to delegate each task here each microservice to team memeber. 
Make indivisual team memeber give ownership and making them accountable for thier task. 
building trust with team and helping them out in anyway possible. 
Ensuring design docs are in place and thier is no scope of ambiguity.   
Always have contingency plan for resources.
