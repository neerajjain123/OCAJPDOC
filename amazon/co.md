MTN camerroon was the best example where we were deploying the payment gateway for their wifi on demand services. They had a genuine problem where around midnight there were serge in the payment failures and consumer were impacted. They reported the issue to my opeartion team which further dealyed the resolution since team shugged it off saying that issue was at the bakend system and API SLA is breaching. Than issue escalated and came to me. I looked into the problem and relaized that it might not be our issue but certianly the platform as a whole. When we debug the problem we realized that OCS(Ericssion server) was breaching the SLA but issue was not with the Ericssion but with the network latency. Later it was identified thet nwtwork were congested since DB backup between two sites and using the same network.

When we launched UPI and finance service as part myjio for CUG customer, we began with the android and ios native development. But the time to production was really high if the bug fixes is require at the client side. Myjio Playstore push require roughly 3 weeks. So I decided that some of the banking feature we can move to web instead of native. Not only this isgnificantly reduced our time to prodution but also the man power which was for android and ios.
